  <h1><a href="https://github.com/kqzz/mcsnipergo">MCsniperGO's GitHub page is here!</a></h1>
  <h2>What is this page?</h2>
  If you're here, you're trying to authenticate for MCsniperGO. This page is the "home page".
  <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
  You probably backed out of authentication or clicked somewhere on the login page.
  <h2>Is this safe?</h2>
  If you reached this page from MCsniperGO, yeah. It's no different than logging in with Prism Launcher.
  <h2>Why is this page not owned by Kqzz?</h2>
  I (implied) am the one who added this login method to MCsniperGO. It was called "mcgo Library Authentication" previously. <b>Kqzz has yet to give me his email, so I have to own this for now.</b>
  <h2>What data does MCsniperGO collect?</h2>
  You can read what MCsniperGO uses the login information for <a href="privacy-policy.html">here.</a>
