  <h1>MCsniperGO Data Collection and Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>What does MCsniperGO collect?</h2>
  MCsniperGO will collect some things known as "login tokens", which are special pieces of text that allow it to act for you with Minecraft's API. This is needed to
  change your name, as it can't do that without the tokens.
  <h2>What does MCsniperGO do with my data?</h2>
  MCsniperGO only uses your login tokens the time you log in, and doesn't store anything anywhere. This may change in the future, in which it'll save your login tokens to disk.
  <h2>How do I remove my data from MCsniperGO?</h2>
  Close MCsniperGO and remove it from <a href="https://account.live.com/consent/Manage">your Microsoft account's app access list.</a>
